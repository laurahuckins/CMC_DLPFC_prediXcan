# CMC_DLPFC_prediXcan
CommonMind Dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex prediXcan models

These models were created by Laura M. Huckins from CommonMind Consoritum (CMC) post-mortem Dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC) data

PrediXcan codes used to build these models are available through https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan

Our manuscript describing creation of these models may be found on biorxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/21/222596
Please cite the latest version of this manuscript when using these models. 

These models may be used on raw genotype or summary-statistic data. 
For more information on the extension to summary statistics ("S-PrediXcan"), please see our manuscript:
